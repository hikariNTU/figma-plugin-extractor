### Prepare plugin information

Every plugin will have its own page in the Figma Community. This allows other members of the to find and install your plugin.

You'll need to provide some information for your plugin page. We recommend getting this set up before you start the publishing process.


- Choose a name for your plugin. This can be something descriptive or a little creative. Users can search for your plugin using this name, but you also have tags to add relevant keywords.
- Create an icon to represent your plugin in the Community. Figma will use this icon to identify your plugin in the Community and in the Editor. The recommended dimensions are 128 x 128.
- Create some cover art for the top of your plugin page. The recommended dimensions are 1920 x 960 (safe area: 1600 x 960).
- Write a description of your plugin. Use this field to explain what the plugin does, how to use it, and a sales pitch. If your plugin requires a subscription, we recommended mentioning this first. You can format your description using some basic text formatting.
- Add up to 12 keywords or tags to classify your File. We support alphanumeric characters (a-z and 1-9), but no special characters or punctuation. Max 25 characters per tag.
- As a plugin creator, it's your responsibility to provide support for your plugins. You'll need to provide an email address, website, or help center for your support contact.
